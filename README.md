# html-parser

I was doing product reasearch online comparing price and demand for a particular product.
So I created a scraper to collect data quickly. It uses BeautifulSoup and urllib.
html-parser search through the html tag and write the data into a csv

files: scraper is the src code, while it might need a little change before it could be rerun in the future since most website keep changing their html tag to prevent web scraping.
